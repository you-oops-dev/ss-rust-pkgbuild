# ss-rust-pkgbuild [![ci](https://github.com/you-oops-dev/ss-rust-pkgbuild/actions/workflows/PKGBUILD-validate.yml/badge.svg?branch=source)](https://github.com/you-oops-dev/ss-rust-pkgbuild/actions/workflows/PKGBUILD-validate.yml)

### Purpose repository
This repository was primarily done for myself. I use this software. Before it was created, [this repository](https://github.com/you-oops-dev/shadowsocks-rust-PKGBUILD) in [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/) was not a binary, and there is still no stable branch. There is no software on Rust. Not every computer compile someone can use the binary version of this software.

### How to switch between build a binary version and not binary package?
**Answer:**
>git checkout binary #Binary version

>git checkout source #Source version

**Note:**
It is best to move on tags because there will be a resulting result.
For example, you are interested in 1.11.0 binary version.
We look all tags:
>git tag

And we see that there is such a version
Go to this commit.
>git checkout v1.11.0-bin

**Designation**:bin-binary version; src-source version

### How exactly to collect the package?
Depending on which the version you need on that branch and switch.

For binary version command in the terminal such:
>makepkg -scC

For source version command in the terminal such:
>makepkg -scCr

### How to install?
>sudo pacman -U PACKAGE
